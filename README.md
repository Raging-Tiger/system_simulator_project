# system_simulator_project

Currently it has functionality of:

1. Simulating one-bit simple quantum behaviour and have one-bit quantum system analysis
  1.1. Initial quantum state could be set from 0 to 360 degrees, or 0 by default
  1.2. Quantum state can be rotated BY any number of degrees in both directions
  1.3. Quantum state can be reflected OVER imaginary axis in degrees (from basic basis)
